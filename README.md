# Classic Command Line Snake Game

This project, created by Aryan Sabounchi in 2014 during high school, is a simple yet entertaining implementation of the classic snake game for the command line interface. Navigate the snake to eat food while avoiding walls and its own growing tail. Each piece of food makes the snake grow longer, increasing the challenge as you progress.

## Installation

To run this game, you will need a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later. This game is designed to run in a Windows environment due to the use of Windows-specific libraries for console handling.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/ar1ans/SnakeGame`.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler, e.g., `g++ -o SnakeGame compile.cpp`.
3. Run the executable in your command prompt: `./SnakeGame`.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to change the direction of the snake.
- Eat the food that appears randomly on the screen.
- Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body.
- The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive gameplay.
- Score tracking and display.
